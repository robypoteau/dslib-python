# Objects and classes

In software development, one of the major paradigms, i.e., ways of thinking, is called object-oriented programming (OOP). In OOP, things with characteristics and behaviors are objects. These things can be concrete or abstract, including a person, a car, a calendar date, or a thought. Additionally, these objects need to have individuality; one person is different from another, just as one date is to another.

To construct an object in a program, we use a class. A class is a template for creating objects because objects have shared characteristics and shared behaviors. Moving forwards, we'll call these class characteristics properties and the class behaviors, methods.

When you use a class to make an object, this is called instantiation; this is why objects are also called instances [of a class].
