"""Create an object that enables you to construct a list of elements which are
placed in nodes, in particularly the SLLNode class. Linked lists can grow
dynamically without concern for elements being contiguous in memory. Each
element points to the next element in the list.


Functions:
    * insert_node
    * remove_node
    * search
    * size
    * is_empty
